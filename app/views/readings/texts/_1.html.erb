Much of the growth in the prison population has occurred over the last 40 years, with those incarcerated for drug-related crimes increasing from 40,000 in 1980 to over 400,000 in 2017.  This increase is attributable to the U.S. government’s War on Drugs, which created mandatory minimums for drug-related crimes.  
Mandatory minimums, require judges to assign long prison sentences for even minor drug-related crimes.  Today, 16% of arrests are for drug-related crimes and the majority of these (86.4%) are only for drug possession

  Community corrections, including probation and parole, allow individuals to continue to work and live in their communities.  Moreover, parole saves the government money. The average cost per parolee is $1,547 a year or $4.24 per day, whereas the average annual per capita cost for imprisonment is $14,603 or $40 a day.
