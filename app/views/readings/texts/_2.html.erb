 typically include two broad dimensions: control and responsiveness. 
 Control or demandingness, refers to the age-appropriate limits, boundaries, and expectations that parents set for their children. 
 Responsiveness or nurturing, includes the affection, acceptance, and caring involved in parenting.  
 Responsive parenting includes accepting a child’s unique needs, perspectives, and abilities and taking these into account, such that parents are attuned to their childrens’ feelings.  
 In short, control describes the behavioral aspects of parenting, while responsiveness describes the emotional aspects. 
 Based on the levels of these two dimensions that parents exhibit, there are four main parenting styles.
</p>

<p>
 Authoritarian parenting reflects a parenting style that includes a high level of control in which limits are set and rules are enforced, yet emotional connectedness is lacking. Authoritarian parents may be viewed as “dictators” who are inflexible and unable to bend the rules to accommodate special or unusual circumstances. For example, a parent might punish a child for receiving a B on their report card, even when all of their other grades are As.

<p>
 Permissive parenting involves limited parental control, with parents either not setting rules for behavior or not enforcing rules. However, permissive parents do have a close connection to their children, such that observers might refer to them as their children’s “friends,” rather than parents. For example, parents may show their affection by giving in to their child’s tantrums or they may ground their adolescent but not monitor whether or not the teenager is actually at home home.

 Uninvolved parenting refers to parents who are lacking in both control and responsiveness. Uninvolved parents typically are unaware of their child’s behavior, friends, struggles, or achievements. For example, a parent may not know what activities or events are happening at the child’s school or may be unable to name his or her child’s friends. These parents are sometimes referred to as neglectful.

 These four parenting styles also differ in the types of expectations that parents hold for their children, particularly with regard to academic achievement, as well as in the degree of

 that they provide.  While both authoritative and authoritarian parenting styles are associated with high levels of academic achievement, authoritative parents provide their children with a greater degree of autonomy support.  While supporting their children’s independence, authoritative parents, nevertheless, retain a close, emotional bond with their children, referred to as relatedness.  This may be why research consistently links authoritative parenting with positive outcomes. Children and adolescents with authoritative parents tend to have high levels of healthy adjustment and manifest few mental health issues or problem behaviors.
